## Step 1: Static HTTP server with apache httpd

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the Docker image.

  ok

* You can do a demo, where you build the image, run a container and access content from a browser.

  ok

* You have used a nice looking web template, different from the one shown in the webcast.

  ok

* You are able to explain what you do in the Dockerfile.

  ok

* You are able to show where the apache config files are located (in a running container).

  ```bash
  root@bfd6bd8816ed:/var/www/html# ls /etc/apache2/
  apache2.conf  conf-available  conf-enabled  envvars  magic  mods-available  mods-enabled  ports.conf  sites-available  sites-enabled
  
  ```

  

  `/etc/httpd/`

* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.

  <mark>TODO</mark>

  

## Step 2: Dynamic HTTP server with express.js

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the Docker image.
* You can do a demo, where you build the image, run a container and access content from a browser.
* You generate dynamic, random content and return a JSON payload to the client.
* You cannot return the same content as the webcast (you cannot return a list of people).
* You don't have to use express.js; if you want, you can use another JavaScript web framework or event another language.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.
